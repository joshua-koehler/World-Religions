# World Religions
## A web app that helps visualize historical data and future trends to gain insight into the world's most critical beliefs.

What is the state of religion globally, regionally, and nationally around the globe?

Which religions are in decline, and which are increasing most rapidly?

If current trends continue, what would the religious composition of the world look like 50 years in the future?

Utilizing machine learning and advanced data visualization, I've created an app to answer questions like these with stunning visuals.

Built with a decoupled React/Django Frontend/Backend, the app is modern, scalable, and reusable for various applications.
